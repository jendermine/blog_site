# Exploration

Once upon a time, there was a penguin named Agniva who lived in a frozen land. One day, while Agniva was out for a stroll, he stumbled upon a strange device lying on the ground. It was a smartphone, and Agniva had never seen anything like it before.

Curious and intrigued, Agniva decided to pick up the phone and take a closer look. As he started to explore the device, he realized that he was stuck inside the phone and could not get out. But instead of panicking, Agniva decided to make the most of his situation and began to explore all the features of the phone, one by one.

One of the first settings he stumbled upon was the toggle for 60Hz refresh rate on battery saver. The penguin wasn’t quite sure what this meant, but he decided to toggle it on and off to see if there was any noticeable difference in the device’s performance. He found that the device seemed to run smoother when the setting was turned off, so he decided to leave it off.

Next, the penguin moved on to the settings for gestures. He found the phrasing for the screen-off UDFPS setting to be a bit confusing at first, but after reading the description, he understood that it allowed him to use the fingerprint scanner to turn off the screen. He was excited to try it out and found it to be a convenient feature.

As the penguin continued exploring, he came across the settings for the phone ringtone on a multi-SIM device. He was impressed by how the device could differentiate between SIM cards and allow the user to set a unique ringtone for each one.

The penguin also found the toggle for QS quick pulldown to be useful, as it allowed him to access his Quick Settings with just one finger. And he was thrilled to discover that he could disable the clipboard overlay, which had been a source of frustration for him in the past.

As he continued to explore, the penguin noticed several improvements in the device’s performance, including improved battery life, seamless doze transitions, and multiple vibration intensity levels. He was impressed by how these small improvements made a big difference in the overall user experience.

Eventually, the penguin stumbled upon the device info settings and was surprised to see his own name listed under Penguin Os entries. He felt a sense of pride and ownership over the device and was grateful for the opportunity to explore all its features.

The Agniva explored was the “Expose saved devices fragment via intent” option. With this feature, Agniva was able to quickly share his saved devices with other devices. He found this feature extremely helpful when transferring files between his phone and laptop.

Next, Agniva found the “Allow hiding QS footer data usage” and “Status network traffic” options. These features allowed him to control his data usage and monitor his network traffic, respectively. Agniva was happy to have these settings as he could easily manage his data usage and monitor his network activity to ensure the best connection.

Agniva also found the “Add toggle for statusbar DT2S” and “Long press power button to toggle torch” options helpful. With these features, he could quickly turn off his screen by double-tapping the status bar or turn on his phone’s flashlight by long-pressing the power button.

Another useful feature Agniva found was the “Add volume panel on left toggle” option. This allowed him to control his phone’s volume with just one hand, making it easier to adjust the volume while on the go.

Agniva also appreciated the “Implement hide gestural navigation hint bar” option, which allowed him to hide the navigation bar to make more space on his phone’s screen. He also loved the “Add three-fingers-swipe to screenshot” feature, which made it easier for him to take screenshots.

Agniva found the “Settings: Add incall vibration options” and “Allow to suppress notifications sound/vibration if screen is ON” settings helpful for managing his phone’s notifications. These features allowed him to customize his phone’s vibrations during calls and suppress notification sounds when his phone’s screen was on.
